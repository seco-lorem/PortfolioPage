Last week of internship I've started learning backend with help of an intern friend. After Internship, I had to disconnect it from company's backend so I decided to build the backend to see it working again. Technologies used in frontend are javascript(React), redux(react-redux), react-router, apollo client(GraphQL), reactstrap(bootstrap), vanilla CSS, JSX. Technologies used in backend are Python, fastapi, graphene(GraphQL), sqlAlchemy. Frontend also includes a video player I created when I was asked if it was possible to build such a thing for advertisements. I've used deta to deploy backend as read-only, firebase to deploy frontend. It is not finished, as it was never intended to be.",
